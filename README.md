** An individual reaseach project ** \
May 2021 â€“ Jun.2021

what I have done: \
1. Studied the heat distribution of the heat equation under different conditions \
2. Researched the heat distribution of a given area (beach) under a changing boundary condition based on mathematical theories and found the analytical solutions \
3. Plotted the heat distribution results under different terrains in python based on numerical iterations \
4. Compared two distribution results with the heat distribution in the actual situation and conducted critical evaluations \
